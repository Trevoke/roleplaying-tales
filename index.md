## An intro session to Changeling: The Dreaming

This session saw Shawna Ravenkind (Seelie Boggan), Mamadou Ibori (Unseelie Eshu), and Knocky McWhosthere (Seelie Pooka), three New York residents and somewhat recent friends, invited to a Beltane festival in Lord Rohain's freehold (or ... One of his freeholds?). Ask Knocky about his amazing diamond-encrusted crocs sometime.

It was mid-evening, but the sky was clear and everything seemed lit as though from a perfect sun. Shadows failed to appear. A light smell of butterscotch filled the air. Griffins soared across the sky, accompanied by a large yellow snake. The freehold looked much like a European medieval castle, strangely gray, surrounded by extremely more-than-real colors. Guards at the entrance checked the invitation and let them in. 

The interior was larger than on the outside. A few Wilder were jumping over balefire, some getting scorched, some getting some applause. Some inanimate chimera were floating around in the air, drawing the eye towards a large cage in which a fae looked happy, then anguished, then exploded into butterflies, then reverted back into a happy fae, and the cycle would repeat.

Lord Rohain welcomed them and remained impassible in the face of Mamadou's severe brown-nosing... For a while. Shawna and Mamadou noticed that Rohain kept on glancing over to someone else, a tall, yellow-skinned woman. Rohain told them that the woman, Elissa, was his sister, and that he feared she was planning on overtaking the freehold tonight. He did not explicitly ask for help, but he did indicate this was at the top of his list of concerns. Rohain could be easily described as snooty. When they asked who the fae in the cage was, Rohain said he was someone who tried to take as much glamour as he could from the balefire to create an amazing chimera and, instead, fell sudden pray to Bedlam, and they keep him here as a lesson.

Knocky went over to try his luck jumping over the balefire. He transformed into a ferret, ran through the legs of the folks waiting in line to jump, then jumped and transformed back into his regular shape. Unfortunately he jumped as a ferret, so he landed square into the balefire and bounced off. He played off the pain and got some laughter, woops and cheers, even a "One more time!" chant.

The group, next, approached Elissa, who, it turns out, was indeed Rohain's sister, and was equally snooty. She indicated that the two had a competition going for control of the freehold, that victory was to be marked by whose flag was flying at the top of the castle at the first stroke of midnight. She offered some chimerical items if the group helped her succeed, and, through Mamadou's negotiating, safe passage through the Dreaming to any freehold they might like if they helped her and she failed. When asked, Elissa replied there were many ways to help, they could take over, they could be stealthy.. She just needed her flag to fly at midnight.

Mamadou decided to go tell Rohain, while Shawna and Knocky decided that Elissa was the one they should help.

Mamadou spoke to Rohain, who confirmed that it was a competition and that it had to do with the flag, flying at the top of the tallest tower. Rohain's flag was a white flag with, in the top left corner, a blue stick figure with an arm 
outstretched, grabbing a blue moon. Mamadou had a plan to take the flag down and hide it, but Rohain refused adamantly.
Mamadou then decided on another tactic and summoned a spirit to find out where Elissa kept her flag hidden. The spirit led him to a door of mellifluous wood, without a handle, which Mamadou simply pushed open. Preternatural dust greeted him, with a single set of footsteps leading behind three casks, where the flag, folded, was resting. It was exactly the same as Rohain's flag, exact the background was red and the moon and stick figure were yellow.

Mamadou set to splitting the flag in two so as to essentially prepare it so that it could fall apart and reveal Rohain's flag underneath.

Meanwhile, Shawna and Knocky asked how they could help Elissa, and she said that if they could distract the guards at the entrance, then her friends could come in. Shawna went to talk to the guards, saying she needed to find something back on the path. The guards, a little perplexed, pointed to the path. She went out and pretended to look for something, while Knocky cast an illusion and made it seem like a tree animated and started attacking Shawna. The guards muttered "Not again" and ran to her help. This allowed three large snakes to slither in and start attacking the partying fae. The guards, having realized the tree was an illusion, and hearing the yells, ran back in, in time to hear Rohain yell for more guards. Six guards came out of various doors and rushed the snakes.

Shawna made her way back and noticed the fight, which wasn't at all what she thought would happen. Knocky looked for Elissa, whom he could no longer see, and then decided to try and run up the stairs towards the flag. Guards came out of that door too and one ran into him, tumbling both down the stairs, while more guards ran past. Knocky, in ferret form again, made his way up the stairs.

Two of the guests fell, their glamour evaporating, and the snakes turned to the guards. Two of the snakes worked in concert, tripping guards and going for their throat. Two guards fell in a shower of glamour before the snakes were defeated.

Apoplectic, Rohain screamed and spittled "FIND HER!" which Shawna believed was for her, and she tried to run out the door to leave the freehold. Unfortunately for her, a spell made it so that as she ran through the door to the outside, she found herself instead running through the door to the *inside*. So she opted for casting a confusion spell on Rohain so that the guards could no longer understand him. This worked and caused enough confusion that she was able to run up the stairs, following Knocky.

Mamadou came out of the basement in time to see the end of the fight, hear Rohain's scream, and see Shawna go up the stairs. He followed, his plan ready for execution.

Knocky changed back to his normal form and asked his chimerical companion, Albion, a flying ferret, to go out the window and scout around, looking for Elissa, because he couldn't see evidence of her going up the stairs, but it seemed logical that she had. All four (including Albion) made it to the top and saw no evidence, though it seemed like there was a contraption for bringing in the flag. 

With mere minutes to midnight, Knocky opted to head outside the window and climb up. The griffins saw him, so he used some glamour to made himself quite forgettable.

Mamadou tested the walls, thinking they couldn't be quite as real as they seemed, but surprisingly, they seemed quite normal. He yelled "I've got your flag!" at which point Elissa revealed herself, having used similar magic to Knocky to make herself unnoticeable. Knocky, meanwhile, decided that the right thing to do would be to take down Rohain's flag and replace it with his black and silver cloak.

Mamadou took out the flag, looking at Elissa, and started to weave a tale about games of capture the flag in Africa. Quite a short tale, he said, in fact, it was just one word: "Catch!" and with that he threw the flag out the window.

Elissa snarled with anger, her mouth widening into a fanged maw, and jumped out of the window, shapeshifting into a dragon as she did so. Rohain, looking upwards to check on the status of the flag, saw her, morphed into a drake and flew into her, barreling her back into the room and morphing them both back into human shape.

Tangled into a sibling fight, overgrown, centuries-old fae were grasping at each other, on the floor, pulling each other's hair in wordless anger, in front of two rather nonplussed changelings. As the first stroke of midnight rang, Rohain yelled out in satisfaction "Hah! My flag is still up there! I win!" ... Which was the time when Knocky climbed down from the roof, showed Rohain's flag and said, "You mean... This flag?"

Realization of the deed dawned upon both of them and they fell apart, as though they turned to sand-glamour. The walls turned to silver, the flames of the torches turned to a radiant black. Looking out the window, the three realized that they were now alone in the freehold: whatever enchantment was this was made it such that all the plans of the previous owner were undone, and the new owner? Knocky McWhosthere.

Shawna, Knocky and Mamadou went back down the stairs and enjoyed a restful evening by the light of the balefire, regaled with some of Mamadou's choice tales.
