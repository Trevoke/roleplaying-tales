## An intro session to Changeling: The Dreaming

This session saw Shawna Ravenkind (Seelie Boggan), Mamadou Ibori (Unseelie Eshu), and Knocky McWhosthere (Seelie Pooka), three New York residents and somewhat recent friends, invited to a Beltane festival in Lord Rohain's freehold (or ... One of his freeholds?).

A light smell of butterscotch filled the air. Griffins soared across the sky, accompanied by a large yellow snake. The freehold looked much like a European medieval castle, strangely gray, surrounded by extremely more-than-real colors. Guards at the entrance checked the invitation and let them in. 

The interior was larger than on the outside. A few Wilder were jumping over balefire, some getting scorched, some getting some applause. Some inanimate chimera were floating around in the air, drawing the eye towards a large cage in which a fae looked happy, then anguished, then exploded into butterflies, then reverted back into a happy fae, and the cycle would repeat.

Lord Rohain welcomed them and remained impassible in the face of Mamadou's severe brown-nosing... For a while. Shawna and Mamadou noticed that Rohain kept on glancing over to someone else, a tall, yellow-skinned woman. Rohain told them that the woman, Elissa, was his sister, and that he feared she was planning on overtaking the freehold tonight. He did not explicitly ask for help, but he did indicate this was at the top of his list of concerns. Rohain could be easily described as snooty. When they asked who the fae in the cage was, Rohain said he was someone who tried to take as much glamour as he could from the balefire to create an amazing chimera and, instead, fell sudden pray to Bedlam, and they keep him here as a lesson.

Knocky went over to try his luck jumping over the balefire. He transformed into a ferret, ran through the legs of the folks waiting in line to jump, then jumped and transformed back into his regular shape. Unfortunately he jumped as a ferret, so he landed square into the balefire and bounced off. He played off the pain and got some laughter, woops and cheers, even a "One more time!" chant.

The group went over to Elissa, who, it turns out, was indeed Rohain's sister, and was equally snooty. She indicated that the two had a competition going for control of the freehold, that victory was to be marked by whose flag was flying at the top of the castle at the first stroke of midnight. She offered some chimerical items if the group helped her succeed, and, through Mamadou's negotiating, safe passage through the Dreaming to any freehold they might like if they helped her and she failed.

Mamadou decided to go tell Rohain, while Shawna and Knocky figured, what could possibly go wrong with helping Elissa?

... To be continued.
